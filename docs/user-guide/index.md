# Mortar User Guide

Mortar is a desktop application that is developed to view [Freedom of Information (FOI) documents](https://www.oaic.gov.au/freedom-of-information), as part of the [Designing Automated Tools to support Welfare Rights Advocacy](https://www.admscentre.org.au/designing-automated-tools-to-support-welfare-rights-advocacy/) project of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Automated Decision-Making and Society.

The Mortar User Guide provides information on how to use Mortar to view and manage PDF documents, as well as the features available in the application.
